- Do dictionary with them.

- What is the internet?
  - it's basically just an interconnected web of devices that are communicating with one
    another. 
   
- If you're connected via something like an ethernet cable, ethernet -> routers -> servers 
  Or, via APs, which are access points, you could we connect wirelessly.
  
- So, I either take my computer and physically plug it into a wall, or I connect wirelessly, and
  now I'm part of this huge web of computers, devices, servers, routers, etc.
  
- This doesn't really give me any added information about what the internet is. I mean this underlying architecture
  is interesting, but it's merely hardware to provide connectivity. What is this connectivity?
  
- The Basic Layers of the internet

	- HTML example (1.html, 2.html, 3.html + style.css)
  		- have them make their own webpage with a link, some styling, a picture, etc
  
	- After you've created your webpage, using developer tools go over:    
    		- DOM
    		- HTTP codes (open up facebook or reddit)
        		- lots of 200s (OK), 307 (redirect), 304 not modified (for cached pages)

- What's bad about the above example?
  - we're re-using stuff HTML, remember how we factored out css that showed up in multiple places?

- MVC
  - what's the controller?

- Pset (show them what to expect).
