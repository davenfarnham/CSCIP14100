How does the PHP version of MVC work?
    - you have your controllers which are php files
    - based on some logic in the php file, it'll render() a template. The
      render function automatically includes the header.php and footer.php
      files, passing in the name of whatever the content should be as variable.
        - header.php
        - <variable>.php
        - footer.php
        
If you want to run HTML on your local machine, easy, just open whatever file you 
have in a browser.

If you want to run PHP though, since it's a server side language you have to run 
a server off your local machine. This is easily done using MAMP. Simply start 
it up, then access any files you've put into htdocs by going to: http://localhost:8888
