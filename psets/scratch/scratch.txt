0:Scratch

This pset is simply meant to introduce you to some concepts important throughout programming.
Even though Scratch uses a GUI, the concepts and tools it introduces are easily transferrable across
languages.

Setup

First, head on over to [MIT's Scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/],select 'join scratch' and 
sign up.

You should get an email, so remember to check for it so you can share your project with me
later!

After you've created an account you should be logged in. In the top left hand corner there should
be an icon to 'create' which will take you to an editor.

Once there, feel free to play around with any of the blocks that control the actions of the cat!

Tasks

For this pset, your goal is to:


                    (1) Change the background
                    (2) Include at least 1 sound
                    (3) Include at least 3 sprites
                    (4) Use a conditional
                    (5) Use a loop
                    (6) and use a variable

Submission

Once you've created a program that includes all 6 of the above tasks, in the top right hand corner
there should be a button that says 'share'. Click it (making sure you've confirmed your email). Once you do
you'll be taken to your project page. There, click 'share' one more time and copy the ensuing URL of your 
project. 

Fill out this form and you're done!
